## **Types of Pods in Kubernetes**

Pods are the smallest deployable units in Kubernetes. Depending on their purpose and container setup, they can be classified into different types.

| **Pod Type**             | **Purpose**                                                | **Detailed Explanation**                                                                                                | **Simple Example**                                                          |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Single-Container Pod** | Runs a single application container                        | Most common type of Pod; contains only one container handling the main application workload.                            | A Pod running only an **NGINX** web server.                                 |
| **Multi-Container Pod**  | Tightly coupled helper containers                          | Contains two or more containers that share storage/network and must run together. Often used for **sidecar** patterns.  | An application container + a **log shipper** container sending logs to ELK. |
| **Static Pod**           | Node-level critical component                              | Managed directly by the kubelet on a node, not via the API server. Useful for cluster bootstrap and critical services.  | `kube-apiserver` or `etcd` running as a static pod on control plane nodes.  |
| **Init Container Pod**   | Prepares environment before main containers run            | One or more init containers run first and exit successfully before the main app containers start. Used for setup tasks. | Init container downloads config files before the app container runs.        |
| **Ephemeral Container**  | Temporary debugging                                        | Special container added to a running Pod for troubleshooting without restarting it. Not part of the Pod spec initially. | A debug container running `busybox` inside a running Pod.                   |
| **Infrastructure Pod**   | Created automatically by controllers for workload patterns | Part of Kubernetes workloads like Deployments, DaemonSets, StatefulSets, Jobs, etc.                                     | A Pod managed by a **StatefulSet** for a database cluster.                  |

**Note:**
> Infrastructure Pod : Not official terminology â€” use it for conceptual clarity only.
> Infrastructure Pods are supporting pods that keep the Kubernetes cluster operational.
> They handle networking, DNS, service routing, control plane components, monitoring, and other internal services.
>   - Run in the kube-system namespace.

### **Quick Tips**

* **Single vs Multi-container:** Multi-container pods share storage/network and are used when containers must work together closely.
* **Static pods** appear in `kubectl get pods --all-namespaces` but are not controlled by deployments or replicasets.
* **Ephemeral containers** are great for debugging production without disturbing running workloads.
* **Init containers** are perfect for database migrations, config generation, or pre-loading data.
